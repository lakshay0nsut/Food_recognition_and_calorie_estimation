## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes images of various food items, each annotated with ground truth labels for class and calories. Density values are also included for accurate calorie computation.

If you're using a public dataset, mention it here, e.g.:

> Dataset: [Food-101](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/)

## 🔍 How it Works

1. **Preprocessing**: Food images are segmented using contour detection and thresholding.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extracts color (HSV histogram), texture (Gabor filters), and shape (Hu Moments) features.
3. **Classification**: Classifies food using a trained CNN or ML model.
4. **Volume Estimation**: Estimates the portion size from the image.
5. **Calorie Calculation**: Calculates total calories using:
Calories = Volume × Density × Caloric Value per Gram
